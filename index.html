  <h2>About Me</h2>
  
      <img id="bioimg"src="assets/images/about me img.jpg" aside="left"/> <p id= "paragraph">My name is shelby, I am 27 years old. I have three little boys their name's are: Jt who will be four in february, Brantley who is two, and Harrison who is 10 months. My favorite things to do are watch movies and go on long walks with my family.
      My favorite movie is Tommy Boy and anything with David Spade. I love old school country music and early 2000's punk rock.
I have been a stay at home mom for almost 4 years, My day's are filled with sticky kisses and cleaning up toys. While I love being home with my kids, my hope is to have a career that I enjoy and excel at. I love learning, and I am excited to see what the future holds!</p>
